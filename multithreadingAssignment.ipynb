    "Multithreading in Python refers to the capability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of other threads, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks within a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to improve the performance of programs that can benefit from parallel execution of tasks. This is particularly useful for tasks that involve I/O-bound operations, such as reading from or writing to files, network communication, or accessing databases. By using multithreading, you can make more efficient use of system resources and reduce the overall execution time of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the threading module is commonly used to handle threads. This module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. You can create a new thread by subclassing the threading.Thread class and implementing the run() method, or by passing a target function to the Thread constructor. The threading module also provides synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, and condition variables to coordinate access to shared resources among multiple threads.\n",
